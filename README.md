# Land Cover Classification on UP42 HOWTO

## Introduction

This is a simple instructional proof-of-concept [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)
[land cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_cover)
classification algorithm that provides a very simple demo of what is
possible to do using UP42.

The goal of this project is to guide you through setting UP42 in your
geospatial pipeline. It shows how easy it is to setup a clustering
algorithm implemented in [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) to
perform land cover classification.

## Block description

This is the
[block](https://docs.up42.com/getting-started/core-concepts.html#blocks)
description in terms of the UP42 core concepts.

* Block type: processing
* Supported input types:
  * [AOIClipped](https://specs.up42.com/v1/blocks/schema.json) 
  (any geo-referenced [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF))
* Provider: [UP42](https://up42.com)
* Tags: machine learning, data processing, analytics, land cover

## Requirements

 1. [git](https://git-scm.com/).
 2. [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).
 3. [UP42](https://up42.com) account credentials.
 4. [Python](https://python.org) 3.5 or later.
 5. Required Python packages as specified in
    `blocks/land_cover_classification/requirements.txt`.

## Usage

### Local development HOWTO

Clone the repository in a given `<directory>`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/up42/land-cover-classification-demo.git <directory>
``` 

then do `cd <directory>`.

#### Run the tests

This project uses [pytest](https://pytest.org/) for testing. To run
the tests do:

```bash
./blocks/land_cover_classification/test.sh
```

from the repository top directory.

#### Build the processing block Docker image 

To build the Docker image for local testing and/or publishing on the UP42
platform you can run the following shell commands from the repository
top directory:

```bash
cd blocks/land_cover_classification/
# Build the image.
docker build -t land_cover_classification -f Dockerfile . --build-arg manifest="$(cat UP42Manifest.json)"
# Go back to the top directory.
cd -
```

#### Run the processsing block 

 * Create the block input `/tmp/input` and output directories `/tmp/output`.
 * Copy the input data (along with the
   [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) file called
   `data.json`) to `/tmp/input`.
 * Build the docker image as outlined above.
 * Run the following command: 
 
```bash
docker run --mount type=bind,src=/tmp/output,dst=/tmp/output --mount type=bind,src=/tmp/input,dst=/tmp/input land_cover_classification:latest
``` 

This [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) the
host and container `/tmp/input` and `/tmp/output` directories into the
**input** and **output** directories respectively. If you wish you can
set it to some other directory that is convenient to you.

### Publish the block to UP42

#### Authenticate into the UP42 registry 

Login into the UP42 [Docker image registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) 
with your UP42 user ID (`<user_id>`) and password:

```bash
docker login -u <user_id> registry.up42.com
``` 
#### Push the block to the registry

Push your block as a Docker image to the UP42 registry like this: 

```bash
docker push registry.up42.com/<user_id>/land_cover_classification:latest
```

Learn more about creating and publishing blocks by reading our
[documentation](https://docs.up42.com/getting-started/first-block.html#).
